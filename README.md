## Data
This app uses the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) to find rhymes. No other datasources are used.
Datamuse is a word-finding query engine that can be used to find words that are likely within the given context and match with the given constraints. Examples of uses include autocomplete, relevancy ranking in searches, assistive writing applications, and word games.
